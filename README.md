                                    - GAME GUIDE FOR NOOBS & BACONS - 

                                        (Startup & Main Menu)
                In this game, you can play in Single-Player or Multi-Player (2 players)
            To choose characters, input the letter next to the character you want to play.

            (Fight Mechanism):

            You have 4 options for each turn -

            - Attack
            - Defend/Regen
            - Items
            - Give Up

            Each character has three attack moves, arranged from least powerful (Attack #1) 
            to most powerful (Attack #3). If you use a move with lower SP than it needs, 
            you don't waste it but you waste your health on it. (same goes for block and dodge)

            For the Defend/Regen option, you can block (uses 10 SP) or dodge (uses 20 SP). 
            Block reduces the amount of damage you get from the opponent's attack, but it
            will still deplete your HP anyway. You will have a 50/100 chance of successfully 
            dodging the opponent's attack (very risky, must be used carefully).

            And for the items, you have a health item, an energy regen item, and two attack 
            items.

            And that's all for the guide. Good luck with the game! :D
